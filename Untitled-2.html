            h1 {
                font-size: ?px;
                font-family: sans-serif;
                text-align: center; (You can also use justify to line up with text)
            }
        
            .img {
                width: 50px;
                height: 50px;
            }

        <h1> h1 means the size of the writting </h1>
        <h2> h2 just is another size which is the second biggest because h1 is the biggest </h2>
        <h3> h3 is the smallest option for size of the writting in these boxes </h3>
        for adding pictures we add this section of code
        
        <div class="img">
        <img src=" name of file for image in here ">
        </div>
        
        img stands for image and src stands for source which basically just the name for the file so it knows what the 
        <p> p stands for parragraph </p> <br> <br>
        this page looks a bit boring to make it look nicer we use css (cascading style sheet) to style it but that is what I will show you next!
